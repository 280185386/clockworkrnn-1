Clockwork Recurrent Neural Network using Theano
===============================================

This is an implementation of the clockwork-rnn described in the paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3511,
which I am using to with the idea. 

Initial experiments do not yield good results with the prediction of piano notes available [here](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~boulanni/icml2012) so I will not pursue to improve this further, but I am leaving it be, because it is a half descent demonstration of a Clockwork RNN implemented with Theano.
